# MindSolutions

Mind Solutions is a Web App that allows its users -- upon subscribing for a membership -- to list and manage their concert tickets, organize their data, have an overview of their analytics, view at a glance the most important events, see how a specific event is performing and much more.
All is possible integrating Viagogo to the platform, thanks to an API Key they kindly gave me.
The whole web app is made with Symfony.
Check my mind-solutions-api repository for the REST API, which is necessary for this project.

Unfortunately, the project has been discontinued due to missing funds. (I can't work for free, forever ðŸ™‚)

Below, are a few screenshots of the working version of the project (Q1 2024).
